## Learning Objectives

- Become familiar with major categories of hardware/software interface
	

		- Industrial programming concepts: programming languages, PLCs/DCSes, Industry 1/2/3/4.0, ISA95 pyramid

		- Components of an IoT system

	

	

	- Collect data from (your own?) IoT devices

## Resources

We have 5 short readings for this class:

	- Read [If you can use open source, you can build hardware](https://redeem-tomorrow.com/if-you-can-use-open-source-you-can-build-hardware)

	- Read pg. 4 in this report, including the diagram: [Industry 4.0 and manufacturing ecosystems](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/insights/us/articles/manufacturing-ecosystems-exploring-world-connected-enterprises/DUP_2898_Industry4.0ManufacturingEcosystems.pdf)

	- Read or skim this article on the [ISA95 Pyramid](https://excelpro.ca/en/news/the-automation-pyramid-isa-95)

	- Differences between PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers) and SBCs (Single Board Computers): read the [first comment on this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/PLC/comments/2a5g4q/comment/ciry1u2/)

	- Skim the first 4 (short!) sections of this doc on Ladder Logic (LL): [how to read ladder logic​​​​​​](https://www.solisplc.com/tutorials/how-to-read-ladder-logic)
	

		- No need to read the "Advanced Circuit Branching Ladder Logic Practice" section or below.

		- Consider that LL may be more intuitive for a technician on a factory floor, but typically LL (and other industrial programming) lacks version control, unit testing, and other infrastructure that supports modern software.
