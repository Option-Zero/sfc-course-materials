## Welcome

Welcome to the Software for Climate course!

 

This is a cohort-based course. It runs for eight weeks, with two classes per week. Each class involves three learning components:

	- **Async reading** materials, presented in slides like this one

	- **Live sessions** involving lecutures, audience participation, group discussions, and Q&A

	- **Homework** assignments

Additionally, we have a **cohort slack channel **for ad hoc communication with the instructors and your fellows in the cohort

 

You will get the most out of this course if you:

	- Complete the reading assignments ahead of the live sessions

	- Attend the live sessions in person

	- Actively participate to build a community with your fellows in the cohort via the slack and during group discussions in the live sessions

These async slides will present the learning objectives for the class and link out to external reading materials.

## Reading

This course does not require professional software engineering experience, but assumes a basic level of familiarity with code. 
 

In the class, you’ll be reading, modifying, and extending existing **Python** code written in **Hex** interactive notebooks

 

Depending on your familiarity with code in general and **Python** specifically, we recommend you review one of these resources:

	- If you already write python, close your laptop and grab a beer, **you’re all set**!

	- If you already write code but not python, spend **up to 1 hour** reviewing this:
	

		- Python cheat sheet & quick reference

	

	

	- If you rarely write code, spend **up to 2 hours** reviewing one of these:
	

		- Python tutorial (free) - chapters 3 & 4 are the most relevant for this course

		- Python tutorial (paid) - an interactive tutorial by Codecademy (7-day free trial period)

	

	

 

We'll introduce **Hex** notebooks as we get to them, but if you're chomping at the bit to learn more now, get started with this:

	- [A beginner’s guide to Python notebooks](https://hex.tech/blog/beginners-guide-to-python-notebooks/)
