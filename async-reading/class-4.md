## Resources

Read through at least one of of these. Here's what we recommend, in rough priority order:

	- Read pages 5-6 in [Growing Pains: the Renewable Transition in Adolescence](https://assets.jpmprivatebank.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/campaign/energy-paper-13/growing-pains-renewable-transition-in-adolescence.pdf), including the chart labeled "US final energy consumption by sector and fuel".

	

		- Consider that decarbonizing our power supply has two steps:
		

			- Electrify everything: all dark brown bars ("Direct fossil fuels") need to change to green ("direct renewables") or blue ("electricity")

			- Decarbonize the grid: The electricity grid has to be 100% clean (green dashed line gets to 100%!)

		

		

		- Both of these are highly complex and nuanced issues with lots of impact opportunities. Modeling is a critical part of this!

	

	

	- Listen to the [Volts podcast: What's the deal with interconnection queues?](https://www.volts.wtf/p/whats-the-deal-with-interconnection) (~50 min)

	- Read pages 10-14 in [An Architect’s Guide to Integrating Energy Modeling in the Design Process](https://content.aia.org/sites/default/files/2016-04/Energy-Modeling-Design-Process-Guide.pdf)

	- Go back to the first doc, Growing Pains, and read/skim:
	

		- Page 15, lower half, addressing "dunkelflaute"

		- Page 35: "Energy in, most of the energy out" 

		- Anything else that catches your eye. This report is full of good stuff!
