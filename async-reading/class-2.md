	- what data sources they are likely using,

	- what processing they are doing, and

	- what value they create

 

Grid data

	- [EPA eGRID Power Profiler](https://www.epa.gov/egrid/power-profiler#/): Renewable energy data

	- [EIA Hourly Electric Grid Monitor](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/US48/US48): Live USA grid data (including interchange with Canada+Mexico)

	- [GridStatus.io](https://www.gridstatus.io/) : A grid data aggregator

 

Jobs data
