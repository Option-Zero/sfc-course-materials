## Learning Objectives

Geospatial and AI are big topics! We're not going to master either of them in this 1-week module - instead we'll aim to get a broad overview, and then a deep dive into one specific intersection.

	- Become acquainted with:
	

		- how spatial data is represented

		- top climate-relevant sources of spatial data

		- how to use AI to scale spatial data insights

	

	

	- Map deforestation using spatial data and AI-driven land cover classification

## Resources

Start with this to get a deep slice of one intersection of Geospatial + AI:

	- Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning (2022). Introduction (pg.  2-5), Farms & Forests (pg. 30-34)

 

And then skim all and/or pick 1-2 to read in depth:

	- [Inside methane monitoring’s big moment](https://www.ctvc.co/inside-methane-monitorings-big-moment/) - Big picture of methane emissions, monitoring, and abatement strategies. Also a good overview of the different scales of monitoring technology, from handheld devices to satellites.

	- [Machine learning to detect mining deforestation across the amazon](https://www.maaproject.org/maap-212-machine-learning-to-detect-mining-deforestation-across-the-amazon/) (2024)

	- [How satellites, algorithms and AI can help map and trace methane sources](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/how-satellites-algorithms-and-ai-can-help-map-and-trace-methane-sources/) (2024)

	- International Energy Agency (IEA) 2024-2026 Electricity forecast - page 31-38, re: electricity consumption due to growth of AI
	

		- a counterpoint: [AI will use a lot of energy. That's good for the climate.](https://climate.benjames.io/ai-go-brrr/) (2024)
